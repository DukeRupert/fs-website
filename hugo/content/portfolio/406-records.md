406 Records is a professional recording studio in Missoula. Kyle Willis built it for Montana artists who shouldn't have to leave the state to work in a serious studio. Recording, mixing, mastering, production — all of it, priced per project, in a space with a lounge and the kind of amenities that make long sessions bearable.

## The Challenge

A studio's reputation travels by sound. But before an artist books time, they look you up. Kyle's previous site didn't match the quality of what was happening inside the building. He needed something that communicated professionalism without being cold — the studio equivalent of a handshake before the session starts.

## What We Built

We built a site for 406 Records that covers the full picture: services, pricing, the studio environment, and the artists Kyle has worked with. The site includes:

- A services section covering recording, mixing, mastering, and production
- Project-based pricing presented clearly — no contact form required to get a number
- A discography and artist roster that builds credibility with new clients
- A bio section that puts a real person behind the studio name
- YouTube integration for artist content

## The Results

406 Records now has a site that works as a first audition. Artists in Montana and beyond can find the studio through search, see the work it's produced, and book time without needing a referral first. The 406 is the Montana area code for a reason — and now the studio that carries that name shows up where it should.
