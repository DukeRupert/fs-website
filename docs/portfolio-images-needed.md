## Notes

- Splash screenshots can be captured from the live sites using browser dev tools or a screenshot service.
- Logos should have transparent backgrounds for use on both light and dark sections. The case study hero applies `filter: brightness(0) invert(1)` to logos, so solid single-color logos work best.
- Client photos are used on the case study detail page next to the testimonial quote (48x48 display size, but provide a larger source).
- All images go in `static/images/portfolio/`.
