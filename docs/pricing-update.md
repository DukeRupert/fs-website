# Firefly Software — Pricing & Services Update Brief

## Purpose

This document outlines updated pricing and a new service tier for the Firefly Software website. Please update the Pricing page and any relevant service pages to reflect these changes.

---

## Context & Rationale

The web development landscape has shifted. Many small Montana businesses are currently paying $17–$40/month for stale Wix or Squarespace sites they built years ago and rarely update. These platforms charge a premium for features most small businesses never use, and provide no local support.

Firefly Software can now deliver a faster, better-looking, custom-built site at a comparable or lower monthly cost — with real local support included. This pricing update is designed to:

- Lower the barrier to entry for static brochure site clients
- Introduce a clear mid-tier for businesses that want dynamic features (CMS, forms, booking)
- Make the value proposition obvious: same price as Squarespace, dramatically better result

## Updated Service Tiers

### Tier 1 — Site Revamp (NEW)

**Pricing:**
| | Price |

**Key message:** *Already paying $20–$40/mo for a Wix or Squarespace site you never update? We'll rebuild it properly and host it for the same price — with a real person to call.*

## Suggested Copy Updates

### Homepage tagline under pricing section

Current: *"Starting at $150/mo"*
Suggested: *"Starting at $35/mo"*

### New value proposition blurb (for homepage or pricing page)

> Already paying for a Wix or Squarespace site that's starting to show its age? We can take what you have, rebuild it properly, and host it for around the same price — with unlimited edits and a local Montana developer you can actually call. No more logging into a platform you don't understand.

---

## Navigation / Page Structure Notes

- The current "Get Found" tier should be replaced or renamed to reflect the two new entry-level options (Site Revamp and Brochure Site)
- Consider adding a short FAQ to the pricing page: *"What's the difference between a revamp and a new site?"*
- The "Fix What's Broken" service page may overlap with the Site Revamp tier — consider linking between them or consolidating the messaging
