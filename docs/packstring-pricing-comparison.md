# Packstring vs. Competitors — Cost Comparison
## What a Montana outfitter actually pays over 1, 2, and 5 years

---

## Assumptions

To make this comparison honest, we need a realistic profile of a Montana outfitter's business:

- **Trip types:** 3–5 (e.g., jet boat, drift boat, lake, hunting)
- **Average trip price:** $450/day (fishing), $3,500/week (hunting)
- **Bookings per season:** 80 trips (a busy solo guide running March–November)
- **Annual gross revenue from trips:** ~$50,000–$80,000
- **Percentage of bookings from website/online:** ~40% (32 trips/year)
- **Average online booking value:** $500 (weighted across trip types)
- **Annual online booking revenue:** ~$16,000

These numbers are conservative for a working Montana guide. A multi-guide operation or hunting outfitter running $3,500–$5,000 hunts will see much higher revenue — and much higher fees on percentage-based platforms.

## Competitor Pricing (Verified)

### FishingBooker (Marketplace)
- **Build fee:** $0
- **Monthly fee:** $0
- **Commission:** 10–30% per booking (guide sets the rate; higher commission = higher listing visibility)
- **Typical rate:** 15–20% based on forum reports and FishingBooker's own data showing 80% of top captains pay 20% or less
- **What you get:** Listing on their marketplace. No custom website. No brand control. They own the client relationship.
- **What you don't get:** Your own website, SEO, availability calendar, direct client contact before booking.

### FareHarbor (Booking SaaS)
- **Build fee:** $0 (or $5,000/year if you use their website builder)
- **Monthly fee:** $0 (commission-only model)
- **Booking fee:** ~6% on direct bookings + 2% on API/OTA bookings
- **Payment processing:** 1.9% + $0.30 per transaction (separate from booking fee)
- **Total effective fee:** ~8% per direct booking
- **What you get:** Booking widget, calendar management, channel distribution, payment processing.
- **What you don't get:** Custom website design (theirs costs $5k/year extra), brand differentiation, direct developer access.

### 3plains (Outfitter Web Agency)
- **Build fee:** ~$1,500–$3,000+ (based on Clutch reviews reporting ~$3,000/year average)

- **What you get:** Custom WordPress or proprietary CMS website, SEO, logo design, content marketing.
- **What you don't get:** Availability calendar, booking/deposit system, inquiry form pre-fill. You'd need to bolt on a third-party booking platform (adding more cost).

- **What you get:** A website you control, basic booking.
- **What you don't get:** Professional design, mobile optimization, SEO, fast load times, security updates, developer support. You maintain it yourself — which means it doesn't get maintained.

## Packstring Savings Summary

### vs. FishingBooker (at 15% commission)

| Timeframe | Solo Guide Savings | Busy Operation Savings | Hunting Outfitter Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 Year | $980 | $3,980 | $6,455 |
| 2 Years | $3,360 | $9,360 | $14,330 |
| 5 Years | **$8,900** | **$23,900** | **$36,275** |

### vs. FareHarbor (6% booking fee, no website)

| Timeframe | Solo Guide Savings | Busy Operation Savings | Hunting Outfitter Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 Year | -$140 | $1,460 | $2,780 |
| 2 Years | $720 | $3,880 | $6,560 |
| 5 Years | **$3,300** | **$11,300** | **$17,900** |

### vs. 3plains (website only, no booking system)

| Timeframe | Solo Guide Savings | Busy Operation Savings | Hunting Outfitter Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 Year | $1,580 | $1,580 | $1,580 |
| 2 Years | $4,160 | $4,160 | $4,160 |
| 5 Years | **$11,900** | **$11,900** | **$11,900** |

Note: 3plains doesn't include a booking system, so the outfitter would need to add FareHarbor or similar on top — making the real savings even larger.

### vs. Outfitter Logic (estimated full-service)

| Timeframe | Solo Guide Savings |
|---|---|
| 1 Year | $2,180 |
| 2 Years | $5,360 |
| 5 Years | **$14,900** |

## The One-Liner Math

**FishingBooker at 20% commission on a $450 fishing trip = $90 gone per trip.**
32 trips booked online per season × $90 = $2,880/year in commissions.

**Packstring after Year 1 = $420/year. Zero commissions.**

The savings from switching off FishingBooker alone covers the Packstring monthly fee 6× over.

For a hunting outfitter running $3,500 hunts at 15% commission:
$3,500 × 15% = $525 per hunt in commission.
**One hunt's commission pays for Packstring for the entire year.**

## What the Numbers Don't Show

The cost comparison above only accounts for direct fees. It doesn't capture:

**1. Lost bookings from a bad website.** If even 5% of visitors leave because the site is slow, confusing, or doesn't work on their phone, that's real revenue lost. On 1,000 annual visitors with a 3% conversion rate, a 5% bounce improvement = 1.5 extra bookings/year = $675–$5,250 depending on trip type.

**2. Time spent on phone tag.** Without an inquiry form or availability calendar, every booking requires 2–3 phone calls. At 80 bookings/season, that's 160–240 calls. An inquiry form with pre-filled dates cuts that in half.

**3. No-show protection.** Without deposits, a no-show costs the guide an entire day's revenue ($400–$500). Stripe deposits collected at booking time eliminate this.

**4. Compounding SEO value.** Marketplace listings build the marketplace's SEO, not yours. A Packstring site with proper structured data, local SEO, and fresh content builds your domain authority over time — an asset you own.

**5. Client ownership.** FishingBooker owns the client relationship. They can change commission rates, delist you, or promote competitors alongside your listing. With Packstring, the client finds you on your site, inquires through your form, and books directly with you. That client is yours.

## The Pitch Line

"The platforms take a cut of every trip. The agencies charge thousands a year. Packstring gives you a custom site, an availability calendar, and deposit collection — for $35 a month and zero commissions. One extra booking per season pays for the whole year."
