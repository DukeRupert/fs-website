## Montana Web Design, Built by Hand

Firefly Software is a Montana-based web development company headquartered in Helena. We build custom websites, fix broken ones, and write software for small businesses across the state — from the Hi-Line to the Bitterroot, from the Flathead to the Yellowstone Valley.

Every project is hand-coded from scratch by a developer you'll talk to directly. No templates, no page builders, no overseas outsourcing. Just clean code and honest work — the Montana way.

## Serving Businesses Across the State

We've worked with businesses in Helena, Missoula, and beyond:

- **[Traver Hardwood Floors](/portfolio/traver-hardwood-floors/)** (Helena) — a sixth-generation flooring contractor. Custom site with service area coverage across five Montana cities and a full project gallery.
- **[Nautilus Group Cleaning Services](/portfolio/nautilus-cleaning/)** (Helena) — a husband-and-wife cleaning company with a professional site built for residential and commercial leads.
- **[406 Records](/portfolio/406-records/)** (Missoula) — a recording studio with a bold online presence featuring a discography, project-based pricing, and artist showcase.
- **[South Hills Church of Christ](/portfolio/south-hills-coc/)** (Helena) — a welcoming church website with service times, ministry info, and visitor outreach.

Each of these sites was built specifically for that business and that community. No recycled designs, no cookie-cutter layouts.

## Why Choose a Montana Developer

Montana businesses deserve a web developer who understands the state. We know that a ranch supply store in Miles City has different needs than a boutique in Whitefish. We know that "just call me" isn't a quaint preference — it's how business gets done here.

When you hire Firefly, here's what's different:

- **One developer, start to finish.** The person who builds your site is the person who picks up the phone when you need a change. No handoffs, no ticket queues.
- **No big-city overhead.** We're a lean operation based in Helena. You get professional-grade work without agency pricing.
- **We're in your time zone.** Mountain time, same as you. When you call during business hours, we answer.

We work with businesses across Montana — in person when we can, remotely when it makes sense. Distance doesn't change the quality of the work or the speed of the support.

## What Every Site Includes

Every website we build comes standard with:

- **Custom design** — built from scratch, not pulled from a template library
- **Hosting and SSL** — included in your monthly rate
- **Unlimited edits** — text, photos, hours, prices — just ask, no extra charge
- **Mobile-first approach** — over 60% of web traffic is from phones, and your site will look great on all of them
- **Fast page loads** — our sites consistently score 90+ on Google PageSpeed
- **Direct developer access** — call, text, or email anytime

## Pricing That Makes Sense

A new custom website starts at **$500 for the build** and **$35/mo for hosting, support, and unlimited edits**. That's comparable to what you'd pay for a DIY builder like Wix — except you get a site that's actually custom-built for your business.

Need a fix on an existing site? Our [Site Rescue](/site-rescue/) service starts at $75 with flat-rate pricing.

Have something bigger in mind — an internal tool, a booking system, a custom dashboard? Our [Custom Software](/custom-software/) service begins with a $250 discovery session.
