## Your Helena Web Developer

Firefly Software is based right here in Helena, Montana — 652 Jena Loop, to be exact. When you work with us, you're working with a local developer who knows this town, knows the businesses here, and picks up the phone when you call.

We build custom websites for small businesses in Helena and across the valley. Not templates. Not page builders. Every site is hand-coded from scratch by the same developer you'll talk to on the phone. That's how it should be.

## Built for Helena Businesses

We've built websites for businesses you might recognize around town:

- **[Traver Hardwood Floors](/portfolio/traver-hardwood-floors/)** — a sixth-generation Helena flooring contractor. We built a site that showcases his work across five Montana cities with a full project gallery and clear service area coverage.
- **[Nautilus Group Cleaning Services](/portfolio/nautilus-cleaning/)** — a husband-and-wife cleaning company right here in Helena. Professional site with residential and commercial services, credentials, and a direct quote flow.
- **[South Hills Church of Christ](/portfolio/south-hills-coc/)** — a Helena congregation that needed a welcoming online home with service times, ministry info, and a clear invitation for visitors.

These aren't stock templates with a logo swapped in. Each site was designed and built specifically for that business, that audience, and that market.

## Why Local Matters

When your website needs an update — new hours, a new service, a photo swap — you shouldn't have to submit a ticket and wait three days. You call us. We answer. It gets done.

We understand Helena's business community because we're part of it. We know that a flooring contractor in the valley needs different things from their website than a tech startup in Bozeman. We know that "local" means something here — and we build sites that reflect that.

There's no call center. No overseas team. No middleman. The developer who builds your website is the developer who maintains it, and he lives about ten minutes from downtown.

## What You Get

Every website we build comes with everything you need to get online and stay online:

- **Custom design** — built from scratch for your business, not pulled from a template library
- **Hosting and SSL included** — covered in your monthly rate, nothing extra to set up
- **Unlimited edits** — change text, photos, hours, or prices anytime at no extra charge
- **Mobile-first design** — your site looks great on phones, tablets, and desktops
- **Fast page loads** — our sites score 90+ on Google PageSpeed, which means higher search rankings
- **Direct developer line** — call or text anytime, no ticket queues or automated responses

## Straightforward Pricing

We keep it simple. A new website starts at **$500 for the build** and **$35/mo for hosting, support, and unlimited edits**. That's less than most businesses pay for Wix or Squarespace — and you get a site that's actually built for you.

Already have a website that needs work? Our [Site Rescue](/site-rescue/) service handles fixes starting at $75 with flat-rate quotes.

Need something more complex — a booking system, a custom dashboard, an internal tool? Our [Custom Software](/custom-software/) service starts with a $250 discovery session to scope the project.

## Let's Talk

If you're a Helena business looking for a web developer who actually lives here, we should talk. No pressure, no pitch — just a conversation about what you need and whether we're the right fit.

**Call us at [(406) 871-9875](tel:+14068719875)** or **[send us a message](/contact-us/)**. We reply within one business day.
