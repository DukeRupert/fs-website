You signed up for Wix or Squarespace because you needed a website and it seemed like the easiest path. Maybe you've been on WordPress for years because someone set it up for you back when it was the default choice. Either way, it worked — until it didn't.

Now you're dealing with a site that's slow, expensive to maintain, limited in ways that frustrate you, or all three. You know you want something better, but the thought of migrating feels like packing up an entire house. Where do you even start? What happens to everything you've built?

Here's what most people don't realize: migration is a two-to-three day process, not a months-long ordeal. You don't have to do it yourself. You don't have to sit in a support chat explaining your problem to someone who can't actually help. A professional handles the content transfer, the redirect mapping, the DNS cutover, and the design rebuild. You hand over your login, and a few days later you have a new site that's faster, cheaper, and actually yours.

The platforms are designed to make you believe leaving is harder than it is. That's by design — it keeps you paying.

## What "Locked In" Actually Means

Platform lock-in isn't about your content. You can always copy and paste your text, download your images, and export your blog posts. The lock-in is everything else.

**Your design doesn't transfer.** That template you spent weeks customizing? It's built using the platform's proprietary system. You can't take a Squarespace design and move it somewhere else. The visual layout, the custom sections, the carefully arranged elements — all of that is expressed in the platform's own code, not standard HTML and CSS that works anywhere.

**Your SEO configuration is entangled.** The URL structure the platform chose for your pages, the meta tags, the internal linking patterns, the XML sitemap format — all platform-specific. When you move, these details need to be carefully mapped to your new site to preserve your search rankings.

**Your domain might be complicated.** If you registered your domain through the platform (which many people do because it's convenient), you'll need to transfer it out. This isn't hard, but it's an extra step with a waiting period, and some platforms don't make the process obvious.

**Integrations stop working.** Forms, booking widgets, email sign-ups, e-commerce — if you're using the platform's built-in tools for these, they don't come with you. Replacements need to be set up on the new site.

**Your email might be tied to it.** Some business owners use email through their website platform. If your @yourbusiness.com email runs through Wix or Squarespace, you need to migrate that too, or risk losing access to your business email.

The platforms know all of this. It's not a bug — it's their business model. Making it easy to sign up and hard to leave keeps customers paying monthly fees even when they're unhappy.

## What You Keep and What You Lose

Here's a realistic breakdown:

**You keep:**
- All your text content — pages, blog posts, descriptions
- Your images and media files (though you may need to re-optimize them)
- Your customer reviews and testimonials (the text, at least)
- Your domain name (with a transfer process)
- Your Google Business Profile and any external listings

**You lose:**
- Your exact visual design (it needs to be rebuilt, which is usually a good thing)
- Platform-specific functionality (built-in booking tools, proprietary widgets)
- Your edit history and revision tracking within the platform
- Any platform-specific analytics data (export it before you migrate)

**You might lose temporarily:**
- Some search rankings (more on this below)
- Email continuity if not handled carefully
- Form submission history stored in the platform

## Will I Lose My Google Rankings?

This is the question everyone asks, and the honest answer is: it depends on how the migration is handled.

A sloppy migration — where URLs change with no redirects, pages get dropped, and the new site launches with missing content — will absolutely hurt your rankings. Google will treat it like a brand new site, and you'll spend months climbing back to where you were.

A properly handled migration preserves your rankings. Here's what that involves:

**301 redirects.** Every old URL maps to its new equivalent. When Google (or a visitor with a bookmarked link) requests the old address, they get automatically sent to the right page. Google transfers the ranking value from the old URL to the new one.

**Consistent content.** The new site should have at least as much content as the old one. If you had a services page, a blog, and an about page, the new site needs all of those. Removing pages during migration sends a signal to Google that your site has less to offer.

**Matching metadata.** Title tags and meta descriptions should carry over so Google sees continuity, not a completely different site at the same address.

**Proper technical setup.** An XML sitemap submitted to Google Search Console, clean URL structure, fast load times, and mobile responsiveness. A well-built new site often has better technical SEO than the platform site it's replacing.

When all of this is done right, most sites see a brief dip in rankings — a few days to a couple of weeks — followed by a recovery to the same level or better. Sites that were being held back by slow platform performance often see rankings improve after migration.

## The Real Cost of Staying

The pricing that got you in the door is not the pricing you're paying now. Every platform follows the same playbook: start cheap, then upsell relentlessly.

**Wix** hooks you with a Light plan at $17/month, but most businesses end up on the Business plan at $39/month to get forms, payments, and basic e-commerce. Add two or three paid apps from the Wix App Market — scheduling, email marketing, advanced forms — and you're looking at $50-65/month. That's $600-780 a year for a website you don't own.

**Squarespace** starts at $16/month for Basic, but most businesses need the Business plan at $33/month or Plus at $39/month. Then come the add-ons: scheduling ($15-30/month), email marketing ($7-17/month), and domain renewal after the free year expires. A realistic monthly bill lands between $55-85/month — $660-1,020 a year.

**WordPress** is the worst offender because the costs are scattered across multiple vendors and it looks cheap at the start. Managed hosting runs $25-50/month. Then you need plugins: Yoast Premium for SEO ($119/year), a form builder like WPForms ($80-160/year), Elementor Pro for page building ($49-84/year), a security plugin like Wordfence ($119/year). That's $300-500/year just in plugin licenses, on top of $300-600/year in hosting. Total: $1,500-4,000/year for a site that still needs manual updates and security patching.

It's death by a thousand cuts. No single charge looks outrageous, but they add up to a monthly bill that would shock most business owners if they sat down and totaled it. And every year the number goes up — platforms raise prices, plugins increase renewal rates, and new "premium" features get carved out of what used to be included.

## When It's Worth Moving

Migration makes sense when:

- **Your costs have crept past what a professional site would cost.** If you're spending $50-80/month on a platform and still managing it yourself, you're already paying more than a professionally built and maintained site — without the benefits.
- **Your site is painfully slow** and the platform won't let you fix it. You can optimize images and reduce plugins, but you can't change the underlying bloat of a page builder. If your site scores poorly on PageSpeed Insights, the platform is probably the bottleneck.
- **You're tired of being your own IT department.** Updating plugins, troubleshooting broken layouts after platform updates, sitting in support chat queues — that's not what you started a business to do.
- **You've hit the limits.** You need functionality the platform can't provide, or can only provide through clunky workarounds. Custom forms, specific layout requirements, integrations with business tools — every platform has walls.
- **You want to own your site.** On a platform, you're renting. You don't control the code, you can't move it, and if the platform changes their terms or shuts down (it's happened), you start over.

## When It's Not Worth Moving

Honesty time. Sometimes staying put is the right call:

- **Your site is doing its job.** If your site loads fast enough, looks professional, generates leads, and you're not frustrated with it, don't fix what isn't broken. Migration has costs and temporary disruption — only do it if the long-term benefits outweigh that.
- **You're running serious e-commerce.** If you have hundreds of products, a full shopping cart, and payment processing through Shopify or WooCommerce, migrating is a much bigger project. It can be done, but the ROI calculation is different than for a brochure site.
- **You just launched.** If you built your platform site three months ago, give it time. Learn what's working and what isn't before committing to a rebuild.

## We Migrate Sites Regularly

Platform migration is a routine part of what we do. Most migrations take two to three days from start to finish. You give us access to your current site, we handle the content transfer, the design rebuild, the redirect mapping, and the DNS cutover. No support chats. No plugin troubleshooting. No learning curve for you.

Most of our clients come from exactly this situation — they outgrew their platform, got tired of the escalating costs, and wanted something that actually works for their business without requiring them to be a part-time web developer.

The result is a site that's faster, cheaper to maintain, and fully under your control. No monthly platform fees, no plugin subscriptions, no proprietary lock-in, no arbitrary limitations.
