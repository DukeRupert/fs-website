title: "You Don't Need an App — You Need a Fast Website"

At some point, someone — a developer, a marketing consultant, your nephew who took a coding class — is going to tell you that your small business needs a mobile app. They'll talk about push notifications, customer engagement, and being "where your customers are."

They mean well. But for the vast majority of small businesses, a mobile app is an expensive solution to a problem you don't have.

## The Math Doesn't Work

Building a mobile app costs somewhere between $10,000 and $150,000 depending on complexity. You'd need a version for both iPhone and Android, which means either building two apps or using a cross-platform framework that adds its own complications. Then there's the ongoing maintenance — Apple and Google update their operating systems every year, and each update can break things that worked fine before.

That's just the build cost. Now you need people to actually install it. The average person uses about nine apps per day, and they're the same ones everybody uses: their bank, social media, maps, and messaging. Convincing someone to download, install, and keep your local business's app is an uphill battle.

Studies show that about a quarter of downloaded apps are used exactly once and never opened again. Another quarter get deleted within the first month.

## Your Website Already Does What an App Does

The features people usually cite as reasons to build an app are things a well-built website already handles:

**"Customers need to find us on their phone."** A responsive website works perfectly on every phone, tablet, and computer. No download required. No app store approval process. No storage space on the customer's device.

**"We need to show up in search results."** Apps don't show up in Google search results. Websites do. When someone searches "electrician near me," Google returns websites, not apps.

**"We want customers to book appointments online."** A booking form on your website does this. It works on every device, doesn't require a download, and can be built in a fraction of the time and cost of an app.

**"We need to send notifications."** This is the one feature that used to be app-exclusive. But modern websites can send push notifications too, through browser notification APIs. And honestly — do your customers want push notifications from their local plumber? Probably not.

## What Your Customers Actually Want

When a potential customer pulls out their phone and looks for a business like yours, here's what they want:

1. To find you quickly (fast-loading site, good search presence)
2. To see what you do and whether you're credible (clear services, photos, reviews)
3. To contact you easily (click-to-call, simple form, visible address)
4. To do all of this without friction (no downloads, no account creation, no hoops)

A well-built website delivers all four. An app adds friction to step four — downloading and installing something is a barrier, not a feature.

## The Exception That Proves the Rule

There are businesses where an app makes sense: companies with a loyalty program that customers use weekly (coffee shops with digital punch cards), businesses that need offline functionality (field service tools), or platforms where the app *is* the product (Uber, DoorDash).

If you're a restaurant with a heavy takeout business, a delivery app integration might make sense. If you're a fitness studio with class bookings and membership management, an app could work.

But if you're a contractor, a professional services firm, a retail shop, or most other local businesses? Your website is your app. Make it a good one.

## Progressive Web — The Best of Both Worlds

Modern web technology has blurred the line between websites and apps almost completely. Progressive web features let a website work offline, load instantly on repeat visits, and even be "installed" on a phone's home screen — all without going through an app store.

Your customers get app-like speed and convenience. You get a single codebase that works everywhere. And you skip the $30,000 app development bill entirely.

## Where to Put That App Budget Instead

If someone quotes you $20,000 for an app, here's what that money could do instead:

- A professionally built, blazing-fast website that ranks well and converts visitors into customers
- Professional photography of your work, your team, and your location
- A year of targeted local advertising to drive traffic to your site
- A complete Google Business Profile optimization with review generation strategy

Any one of those will generate more business than an app that sits unused on twelve people's phones.

## The Bottom Line

Don't let anyone sell you an app when what you need is a website that works. A fast, mobile-friendly site that loads instantly, looks professional, and makes it easy to get in touch will outperform an app for virtually every small business.
