There's a marketing tool that puts your business directly in front of people who are actively searching for what you sell. It shows up above the regular search results. It appears on Google Maps. It displays your hours, your phone number, your reviews, and your photos. It's completely free.

And most small business owners either haven't claimed it or set it up once three years ago and never looked at it again.

Google Business Profile is the single most impactful thing a local business can do for online visibility. More impactful than your website's SEO. More impactful than social media. More impactful than any paid advertising you could run. And it doesn't cost a cent.

## What Google Business Profile Actually Is

When you search for "plumber near me" or "coffee shop Helena MT," Google shows a map with a handful of businesses pinned on it, along with their names, ratings, hours, and phone numbers. That section — the "Local Pack" or "Map Pack" — is powered by Google Business Profile (GBP).

Your GBP listing is essentially your business's profile page on Google. It contains your name, address, phone number, website, hours, photos, reviews, posts, and a description of what you do. Google uses this information to decide whether to show your business when someone nearby searches for your services.

**This is not optional.** If you're a local business, the Map Pack is where the action is. Studies consistently show that 42% of local searches result in a click on the Map Pack. Many searchers never scroll past it to the regular results below. If you're not in that map section, you're invisible to nearly half of the people searching for businesses like yours.

## The Basics: Claiming, Verifying, and Filling It Out

If you haven't claimed your profile yet, start here. Go to Google Business Profile and search for your business. If it already exists (Google often creates listings automatically from public data), claim it. If it doesn't, create one.

Google will verify that you're the actual owner, usually by sending a postcard with a code to your business address. This takes a few days. Some businesses can verify by phone or email.

Once you're in, fill out everything. Not just the basics — everything.

**Business name.** Your actual business name, not a keyword-stuffed version. "Smith Plumbing" is correct. "Smith Plumbing — Best Emergency Plumber in Helena MT" will get your profile suspended.

**Category.** Pick the most specific primary category that fits. "Plumber" is better than "Home Services." You can add secondary categories too — use them. If you do both residential and commercial plumbing, add both relevant categories.

**Address and service area.** If customers come to you, show your address. If you go to customers, set a service area instead. You can do both if applicable.

**Phone number and website.** Your direct business number and your website URL. Make sure these are consistent with what's on your actual website.

**Hours.** All of them. Regular hours, holiday hours, special hours. Keep these updated — nothing frustrates a customer more than driving to a business that Google said was open and finding it closed.

**Business description.** You get 750 characters. Use them to clearly describe what you do, who you serve, and what makes you different. Write for humans, not search engines.

**Attributes.** Google offers dozens of attributes depending on your category — veteran-owned, women-owned, wheelchair accessible, free Wi-Fi, accepts credit cards. Check every one that applies. These show up on your profile and help Google match you with relevant searches.

## The Things That Actually Move the Needle

A complete profile gets you in the game. These are the things that move you up the rankings:

### Reviews

Reviews are the single biggest factor in local search rankings after your basic profile information. More reviews and higher ratings mean Google shows you more often and more prominently.

**Ask for reviews systematically.** Don't wait for customers to think of it — most won't. After a completed job, send a follow-up message with a direct link to your Google review page. Make it as easy as one click.

**Use reciprocity to your advantage.** There's a well-documented principle in behavioral psychology: when someone gives you something, you feel obligated to give something back. It's why national survey companies mail you a few dollars with the questionnaire — even though there's no contract, the majority of people who keep the money fill out the survey. The gift creates a sense of obligation.

This works for reviews too. A small, genuine gesture after completing a job — a handwritten thank-you note, a plate of cookies, a $5 gift card to a local coffee shop — costs you almost nothing but triggers that same reciprocity instinct. When you follow up a day later with "We'd really appreciate a Google review if you have a minute," the customer is far more likely to do it. They already feel like they owe you one.

This isn't manipulation. You're doing good work and treating your customers well. The small gift just makes them more likely to follow through on something they were already inclined to do. At $5 a review, it's the cheapest and most effective marketing spend in your budget.

**Respond to every review.** Every one. Thank people for positive reviews with something specific — not just "Thanks for the review!" but "Glad we could get your furnace running before that cold snap." For negative reviews, respond professionally, acknowledge the issue, and offer to make it right. Potential customers read your responses as much as they read the reviews themselves.

**Don't fake it.** Google's algorithms are sophisticated enough to detect fake reviews, and the consequences — profile suspension or removal — are severe. Build reviews honestly over time. A steady stream of authentic reviews beats a sudden batch of five-star ratings every time.

### Photos

Businesses with photos get 42% more requests for driving directions and 35% more website clicks than those without. Google has published these numbers — this isn't speculation.

**Post real photos of your business.** Your storefront, your team, your work, your equipment, your finished projects. Not stock photos — real images that show what your business actually looks like. Customers want to see the actual place they're going to visit or the actual person who's coming to their house.

**Keep adding photos.** Don't upload ten photos when you set up your profile and never add another. Add new photos regularly — completed projects, seasonal updates, new team members. Google notices activity, and recent photos make your profile look current and active.

**Quality matters, but perfection doesn't.** A well-lit photo from a modern smartphone is fine. You don't need professional photography for every image. But dark, blurry, or irrelevant photos hurt more than they help.

### Posts

Google Business Profile has a posting feature that most businesses ignore completely. You can publish updates, offers, events, and announcements directly on your profile. These show up when people view your listing and signal to Google that your business is active.

**Post regularly.** Once a week is ideal, but even once or twice a month keeps your profile active. Share completed projects, seasonal promotions, business updates, or helpful tips related to your industry.

**Keep posts focused.** Each post should have one clear topic and, when appropriate, a call to action — "Call for a free estimate," "Book online," "Learn more."

### Questions and Answers

Your GBP has a Q&A section where anyone can ask questions about your business — and anyone can answer them. If you're not monitoring this, random people might be answering questions about your business incorrectly.

**Seed your own Q&A.** You can ask and answer your own questions. Think about the things customers ask you most often — "Do you offer free estimates?" "What areas do you serve?" "Are you licensed and insured?" — and add those as Q&A entries. This puts accurate information directly on your profile and saves you from answering the same questions repeatedly.

## Common Mistakes That Hurt Your Visibility

**Keyword stuffing your business name.** This is the most common violation and Google actively penalizes it. Your business name field should contain your legal business name, nothing more. Adding "Best," city names, or service keywords will get your profile flagged or suspended.

**Inconsistent information.** If your website says you're open until 6 PM, your GBP says 5 PM, and Yelp says 7 PM, Google doesn't know which to trust. Consistency matters across every platform where your business appears.

**Ignoring negative reviews.** An unanswered negative review tells potential customers that you don't care about the problem or don't monitor your online presence. Both are bad signals. Respond promptly and professionally.

**Setting it and forgetting it.** A GBP profile that was last updated two years ago signals to Google that the business may not be active. Keep your hours current, add new photos, post updates, and respond to reviews. Activity signals relevance.

**Using a P.O. Box or virtual office address.** Google requires a real physical location where you conduct business or meet customers. Using a P.O. Box, UPS Store address, or virtual office can result in suspension. If you're a service-area business that goes to customers, hide your address and set a service area instead.

## Your Website and Your GBP Work Together

Your Google Business Profile and your website aren't competing — they're complementary. Your GBP gets you visibility in map results and provides quick-reference information. Your website gives visitors the full picture — your portfolio, detailed service descriptions, testimonials, and a way to contact you.

The two should reinforce each other. Your website should have the same business name, address, phone number, and hours as your GBP. Your GBP should link to your website. When someone finds you on the map and wants to learn more, your website should deliver a fast, professional experience that converts that curiosity into a phone call or form submission.

A great website with a neglected GBP is leaving local search visibility on the table. A great GBP with a bad website is wasting the traffic it generates. You need both working together.
