Firefly Software, LLC ("we," "us," or "our") operates the website fireflysoftware.dev. This privacy policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding that information.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

When you contact us through our website, we collect the information you submit in the contact form, which may include:

- Your name
- Email address
- Phone number
- The content of your message

We only collect this information when you voluntarily submit it through our contact form.

### Information Collected Automatically

We use **Plausible Analytics** to understand how visitors use our website. Plausible is a privacy-focused analytics tool that does not use cookies, does not collect personal data, and does not track individual visitors across sites. The data collected includes general information such as pages visited, referring websites, browser type, and approximate geographic region. This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you personally.

You can review Plausible's data practices at [plausible.io/data-policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy).

### Cloudflare Turnstile

Our contact form uses **Cloudflare Turnstile**, a bot-detection service provided by Cloudflare, Inc. When you submit the contact form, Turnstile may collect technical data such as your IP address, browser type, and interaction patterns to verify that you are a real person. Cloudflare may set a cookie on your device for this purpose.

You can learn more about Cloudflare's privacy practices at [cloudflare.com/privacypolicy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

### Google Fonts

This website loads fonts from **Google Fonts**, a service provided by Google LLC. When you visit our site, your browser connects to Google's servers to download font files. This may transmit your IP address and browser information to Google.

You can learn more about Google's data practices at [policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

### Google Maps

Our contact page includes an embedded **Google Maps** widget to show our office location. When you load that page, your browser connects to Google's servers, which may collect your IP address, browser information, and cookies.

You can learn more about Google's data practices at [policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

We use the information you provide through our contact form to:

- Respond to your inquiry
- Provide estimates or quotes for web design and development services
- Schedule consultations or appointments
- Communicate with you about website projects you've requested

## Information Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties.

We may share your information only in the following circumstances:

- **Legal requirements:** We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to a valid legal request.

## Cookies

This website does not use cookies for analytics or advertising. Our analytics tool (Plausible Analytics) is cookieless and does not store any data on your device.

Cloudflare Turnstile may set a functional cookie when you use our contact form to verify that you are not a bot. Google Maps and Google Fonts may also set cookies when your browser connects to Google's servers. These are third-party cookies outside of our direct control.

You can control or delete cookies through your browser settings.
