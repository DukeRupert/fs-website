Christian Brother's Lining Co. has been rehabilitating pipelines across the SF Bay Area and Northern California since 2008. More than 300 projects. More than 250,000 linear feet of pipe restored using CIPP lining, manhole rehabilitation, CCTV inspection, and hydro jetting. That's the kind of resume that closes contracts — but only if the right people can see it.

## The Challenge

CB Lining's existing site undersold their experience and didn't clearly explain their services to the municipal and commercial clients making procurement decisions. Pipeline rehabilitation is a specialized field. Buyers need to trust the contractor before they issue a project. The site wasn't building that trust.

## What We Built

We built a professional services site for CB Lining that covers each of their core service lines — CIPP pipe lining, manhole rehabilitation, CCTV inspection, and hydro jetting — with enough technical detail to be credible without becoming a manual. The site includes:

- Dedicated service pages structured for the search terms their clients actually use
- A clear overview of licensing, insurance, and service area for Northern California and the Bay Area
- A careers section for recruiting field crews
- A direct contact flow suited for commercial and municipal inquiries

## The Results

CB Lining now has a site that matches the scale of their operation. Visitors get a clear picture of what the company does, how long they've been doing it, and how to get in touch. For a company whose work happens underground, a strong surface presence makes the difference.
