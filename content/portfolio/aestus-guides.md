Aestus Guides is a one-person content operation producing in-depth guides for classic and modern computer RPGs. The site covers character builds, system analysis, tier lists, and tactical breakdowns across titles like Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate 3, Pillars of Eternity, and Pathfinder. The audience is dedicated — the kind of players who read 3,000-word build guides before rolling a character.

## The Challenge

Years of detailed content needed a home that could organize it by game, category, and tag without burying older posts. The site had to load fast, read well on any device, and let the writing do the talking. No clutter, no ads fighting the content for attention.

## What We Built

We built a clean, content-first site for Aestus Guides that puts the archive front and center. The site includes:

- Category and tag-based navigation spanning multiple RPG franchises and systems
- A reading experience built for long-form guides — clear typography, generous spacing, no distractions
- Dark mode support for late-night reading sessions
- Developer interviews and editorial content alongside the core guide library

## The Results

Aestus Guides now has a site that matches the depth of its content. Readers can find what they need by game, by system, or by browsing the full archive. For a content creator, the site works the way a good guide does — it gets out of the way and lets the substance speak.
