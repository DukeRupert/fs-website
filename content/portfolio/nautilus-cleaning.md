Nautilus Group Cleaning Services is a husband-and-wife operation in Helena, Montana. David and WendiSue Nash handle residential and commercial cleaning across Lewis & Clark County — everything from recurring home cleanings to post-construction site work. Fully insured, bonded, and licensed, with 25+ years of combined experience between them.

## The Challenge

A cleaning company lives or dies on trust. Clients are handing over keys to their homes and offices. David and WendiSue had the credentials and the track record, but no online presence that communicated either. In a market where people search before they call, being invisible online meant losing jobs to competitors with worse work and better websites.

## What We Built

We built a professional site for Nautilus Group that covers both their residential and commercial service lines with enough detail to answer the questions a prospective client actually has. The site includes:

- Separate residential and commercial service sections covering standard cleaning, deep cleaning, move-in/move-out, janitorial, floor care, and post-construction cleanup
- Clear presentation of credentials — insured, bonded, licensed, Chamber of Commerce member
- An about section that tells the story of two people who moved to Montana and built a business the right way
- A direct quote request flow so prospective clients can describe their space and get a response fast

## The Results

Nautilus Group now has a site that matches the professionalism of their work. Helena residents and businesses can find them through search, see what they offer, verify their credentials, and request a quote without needing a referral first. For a local service business, that's the difference between waiting for the phone to ring and making it ring.
