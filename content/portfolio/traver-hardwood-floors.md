Chris Traver is a sixth-generation Montana native. He has been installing and restoring hardwood floors for 18 years. He doesn't need to explain what he does — he needs people across Montana to find him when they're ready to hire someone.

## The Challenge

Word-of-mouth carries weight in Montana, but it has a geographic ceiling. Chris serves Helena, Bozeman, Butte, Great Falls, and Missoula. Without a site that ranked for those markets, he was invisible to customers outside his immediate network. His previous online presence didn't reflect the quality of his work or give potential clients any reason to call.

## What We Built

We built a clean, fast website for Traver Hardwood Floors that covers the full scope of his services: installation, sanding, finishing, and restoration. The site includes:

- A project gallery showing finished floors across different wood species and finishes
- Individual service pages structured for search visibility in each market he covers
- A clear contact flow — no friction between a visitor and a phone call
- An about page that tells the story of a sixth-generation Montanan who does this work for a living, not a franchise

## The Results

Chris now gets inbound calls from customers across his service area who found him through search. The site does the work of a first introduction — showing the quality of his craftsmanship before he ever picks up the phone.
