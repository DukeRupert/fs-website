South Hills Church of Christ is a Helena, Montana congregation centered on community worship and spiritual growth. They gather at 2294 Deerfield Lane for Sunday Bible study and worship, and serve families through ministries for women, men, youth, and children. Their mission is simple: reveal God, renew lives, and rejoice together.

## The Challenge

A church without an online presence is invisible to newcomers. People searching for a church home in Helena need to find service times, location, and a sense of what the community is like — all before they decide to visit. South Hills needed a site that answered those questions honestly and warmly.

## What We Built

We built a welcoming, straightforward site for South Hills Church of Christ that gives visitors everything they need to take the next step. The site includes:

- Clear service times and location with directions
- An overview of ministries covering all age groups and interests
- Integration with YouTube for sermon access and digital giving options
- Messaging that reflects the congregation's values — welcoming, grounded, and community-focused

## The Results

South Hills Church of Christ now has a digital front door that reflects who they are. Helena residents searching for a church home can find them, learn what to expect, and feel invited before they ever walk in. For a congregation built on personal connection, the site extends that welcome online.
