Momentum Business Solutions handles bookkeeping, payroll, and financial consulting for growing businesses — the kind doing between $500,000 and $5 million in revenue. Cade Maldonado is a QuickBooks ProAdvisor and operates remotely across the US from Richland, WA. His clients trust him with numbers that matter. The site needed to earn that trust before the first conversation.

## The Challenge

Financial services clients are cautious by nature. A weak web presence doesn't just fail to convert visitors — it actively works against you. Cade needed a site that communicated competence and specificity: who he works with, what he handles, and why a growing business should hand off its books to someone they found online.

## What We Built

We built a clean, professional site for Momentum Business Solutions that covers the full scope of their services without burying the visitor in jargon. The site includes:

- A services section covering bookkeeping, payroll processing, and financial consulting
- Clear positioning for businesses in the $500K–$5M revenue range — specific enough to qualify the right clients
- An about section that establishes Cade's credentials, including his QuickBooks ProAdvisor certification
- A contact flow suited for professional service inquiries, not a generic form

## The Results

Momentum Business Solutions now has a site that holds up to scrutiny. Prospective clients can understand exactly who Cade works with, verify his credentials, and make contact without friction. For a remote financial services firm, the website is the front door — and this one opens the right way.
